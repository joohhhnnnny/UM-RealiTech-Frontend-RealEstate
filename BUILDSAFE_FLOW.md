# üèóÔ∏è BuildSafe - Construction Progress Tracking

## The Correct Flow

### 1. **BuySmartPH** (Application & Purchase)
- Buyer submits documents
- Application gets reviewed  
- Application gets **approved**
- Buyer **purchases** the property

### 2. **BuildSafe** (Construction Tracking) 
- Buyer tracks **construction progress** of purchased property
- Views **construction milestones** (foundation, structural, roofing, etc.)
- Monitors **escrow payments** released based on construction milestones
- Downloads **property documents** delivered by developer

## Key Differences

| Feature | BuySmartPH | BuildSafe |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Property application & purchase | Construction progress tracking |
| **User Status** | Applicant/Buyer | Property Owner |
| **Progress Type** | Document submission (0-100%) | Construction completion (0-100%) |
| **Data Source** | Document submission status | Construction milestone completion |
| **Documents** | Buyer submits to developer | Developer delivers to buyer |
| **Payment** | Down payment, loan application | Escrow release based on milestones |

## Navigation Flow

```
User Journey:
1. Browse Properties
2. BuySmartPH ‚Üí Submit Application ‚Üí Get Approved ‚Üí Purchase
3. BuildSafe ‚Üí Track Construction ‚Üí Monitor Progress ‚Üí Receive Property
```

## Current Implementation ‚úÖ

- **BuyerBuildSafe.jsx**: Now correctly shows purchased properties construction tracking
- **Components moved to**: `/buyerportal/` (separate from developer portal)
- **Focus**: Construction milestones, escrow management, property document delivery
- **Data**: Only shows approved/purchased properties from BuySmartPH

The system now properly separates:
- **BuySmartPH**: Application ‚Üí Purchase
- **BuildSafe**: Construction ‚Üí Delivery
